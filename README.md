# Smart-Home-Automation-System
The Smart Home Automation System (Voice Controlled) is a modern solution designed to make everyday life more convenient, secure, and efficient. By using voice recognition technology, this system allows users to manage household appliances and systems with simple voice commands, eliminating the need to rely on traditional switches or remote controls.
This project brings together key elements of embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create a centralized and easy-to-use interface for managing various devices around the home. Imagine being able to switch on the lights, adjust the fan speed, just by speaking—it’s this kind of seamless integration that makes the system practical and appealing.
